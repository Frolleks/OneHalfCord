# OneHalfCord
 A Discord theme based on the Vim theme, One Half.
## Installation
### BetterDiscord
This theme is currently only for Powercord for now. I will add BD support soon.
### Powercord
For Powercord, open your command terminal and copy and paste this command: `cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/rolledev/onehalfcord` and fetch missing themes. If you have the [PowercordThemeDownloader](https://github.com/ploogins/PowercordThemeDownloader) plugin, go to the Powercord Discord server and find this theme in #theme-links. Once you've find it, click the "Download Theme" button and you're good to go.
### GooseMod
Hey, reader. Can you ask for this theme to be ported to GooseMod in the GooseMod Discord? Thank you very much.
